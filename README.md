# Zugzwang

**Zugzwang** is a self-led, senior project: a real-time online chess platform featuring a Go-based backend, a modern web frontend, and a custom-built chess engine.

The project will be launched shortly.

## Collaborators

## Goals
The primary goals of this project are to:
- **Design, build, and deploy** a production-quality web application that demonstrates core computer science fundamentals
- Strengthen skills in **Go, TypeScript, and React**, with an emphasis on concurrency, networking, and state management
- Built a clean, modern frontend that users can play chess on 
- Implement a competitive chess engine with a target playing strength of **~1800 ELO**
- Track basic analytics about the users

## Design
A design document will be released shortly, touching on our system design, frontend state management, and deep-dive into the engine.
